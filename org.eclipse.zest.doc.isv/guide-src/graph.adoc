= Graph

A graph represents the root widget for all Zest models and contains both edges
and vertices. Both elements are added automatically to the graph when creating
new instances of either `GraphConnection` (for edges) and `GraphNode` (for
vertices), using the graph as constructor argument.

Vertices can either be simple nodes or subgraphs, which themselves can contain
additional vertices.

== Graph Viewer

Alternatively, graphs can also be created using the JFace structured viewers.
Edges and vertices are created by supplying a special ContentProvider and can be
stylized by a special LabelProvider.

=== Content Provider

The content provider may implement one (but not multiple) of the following
interfaces:

- `IGraphEntityContentProvider` for graphs based on vertices. This content
   provider returns all vertices contained by this graph and for each vertex,
   the vertices it is connected to.
- `IGraphEntityRelationshipContentProvider` for graphs based on edges. This
   content provider returns all edges contained by this graph. The union of all
   source and destination vertices define the vertices contained by this graph.
- `IGraphContentProvider` for graphs based on pairs of vertices. This content
  provider is similar to the `IGraphEntityRelationshipContentProvider`
  where each pair represents an edge between a source and destination vertex.
- `ITreeContentProvider`, for hierarchical graphs. A vertex is only connected
  to its children, which themselves are represented as containers.

Additionally, the content provider may implement the `INestedContentProvider`
interface (except the `ITreeContentProvider`) to support sub-graphs.

=== Label Provider

The label provider may implement one (but not multiple) of the following
interfaces:

- `ISelfStyleProvider` for generic customizations of both edges and vertices,
   such as dotted lines.
- `IConnectionStyleProvider` (Edges only) for contributing details about an
   edge. Incompatible with `IEntityConnectionStyleProvider`.
- `IEntityConnectionStyleProvider` (Edges only) for contributing details
   about an edge. Here the edge is described via the source and destination
   vertices. Incompatible with `IConnectionStyleProvider`
- `IEntityStyleProvider` (Vertices only) for contributing details about a
   vertex.

Additionally, the label provider may implement the `IFigureProvider` interface
to supply custom figures for the graph elements.

== Graph Node

Each vertex is implemented by a _GraphNode and backed by a _model figure_ for
visualization. Available classes are:

- `GraphNode` is the default implementation used for vertices where the
   attributes are defined by the widget.
- `CGraphNode` is a custom implementation used for vertices where the
   attributes are defined by the underlying figure.
- `GraphContainer` is the default implementation used to visualize subgraphs.

=== "Hide Node" Feature

When the graph has been created with the "hide node" feature enabled, the
_model figure_ is contained by a _node figure_, providing additional decorations
such as a _hide_ and _reveal_ button.

As the name suggests, the _hide_ button will hide the node from the graph, while
the _reveal_ button reveals all connected, hidden vertices. The number describes
how many adjacent vertices are current hidden.

NOTE: If this feature is disabled, the _model figure_ and _node figure_ are
identical.

== Graph Connection

Each edge is implemented by a _GraphConnection_ and connects two _GraphNodes_.
The shape of this connection can be customized using the _ConnectionRouter_ from
Draw2D.

NOTE: Graph connections are always added to the _Graph_, regardless of whether
the node are inside a sub-graph. This means that it is possible to e.g. connect
two vertices in separate sub-graphs.
