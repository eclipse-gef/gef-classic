== BreakIterator

The link:../reference/api/org/eclipse/draw2d/text/FlowUtilities.html[*`FlowUtilities`*]
class uses the native _BreakIterator_ class to determine the boundaries between
words. Clients may contribute their own implementation by contributing a custom
_BreakIteratorProvider_ via SPI. If multiple services are contributed, the first
one is chosen.

=== Example: How to supply a custom BreakIterator

____
Users may want to use the break rules from e.g. ICU instead of the JDK rules.
Because those classes don't share a common interface, the user has to extend
the abstract _BreakIterator_ class and call the corresponding ICU method for
abstract method that is overwritten.
____

=== Solution:

____
SPI uses the context-classloader to instantiate the custom implementation. In
order to use this mechanism in OSGi with minimal complications, it is
recommended to create this class within a Draw2D fragment. Also note that this
class needs to be registered via _META-INF/services/java.text.spi.BreakIteratorProvider_

[source,java]
----
public class CustomBreakIteratorProvider extends BreakIteratorProvider {
	@Override
	public BreakIterator getWordInstance(Locale locale) {
		...
	}

	@Override
	public BreakIterator getLineInstance(Locale locale) {
		...
	}

	@Override
	public BreakIterator getCharacterInstance(Locale locale) {
		...
	}

	@Override
	public BreakIterator getSentenceInstance(Locale locale) {
		...
	}

	@Override
	public Locale[] getAvailableLocales() {
		...
	}
}

== Bidi

Similarly to the _BreakIterator_, the link:../reference/api/org/eclipse/draw2d/text/BidiProcessor.html[BidiProcessor]
class uses the native _Bidi_ class to determine whether a text requires a Bidi
analysis. Clients may contribute their own implementation by contributing a
custom link:../reference/api/org/eclipse/draw2d/text/BidiProvider.html[BidiProvider]
via SPI. If multiple services are contributed, the first one is chosen.

=== Example: Custom BidiProvider Service

____
The Bidi algorithm provided by the JDK might not be sufficient to determine,
whether a given text requires further analysis.

=== Solution:

____
SPI uses the context-classloader to instantiate the custom implementation. In
order to use this mechanism in OSGi with minimal complications, it is
recommended to create this class within a Draw2D fragment. Also note that this
class needs to be registered via _META-INF/services/org.eclipse.draw2d.text.BidiProvider_.

[source,java]
----
public class CustomBidiProvider implements BidiProvider {
	@Override
	public boolean requiresBidi(char[] text, int start, int limit) {
		...
	}
