= Draw2d Architecture

== Draw2d Overview

Draw2d is a lightweight toolkit of graphical components called
*_figures_*. Lightweight means that a figure is simply a java object,
with no corresponding resource in the operating system. Figures can be
composed via a parent-child relationship. Every figure has a rectangular
*_bounds_* inside which it, and its children, paint. A layout manager
can be used to place children based on their index and/or constraint.

A `LightweightSystem` associates a figure composition with an SWT
Canvas. The lightweight system hooks listeners for most SWT events, and
forwards most of them to an `EventDispatcher`, which translates them
into events on the appropriate figure.

Paint events, however, are forwarded to the `UpdateManager`, which
coordinates painting and layout. Figures can be updated in ways which
affect their appearance or size, and the update manager ensures that
only one layout occurs, followed by a repaint of only the region which
was updated.

Any type of diagram, document, or drawing can be easily constructed and
efficiently updated by combining the provided figure and layout
implementations along with the use of custom figures or layouts when
needed.
