Draw2D has dropped ICU as the default Java implementation for *`Bidi`* and
*`BreakIterator`*. If clients require a different behavior, they may contribute
their own implementation as described in link:extensions.html[User-specific extensions].

The selection, stack and property `Actions` of the `GraphicalEditor` can only
hold Strings and no longer support objects of type IAction. Clients can convert
their actions by explicitly calling *`IAction.getId()`*.
