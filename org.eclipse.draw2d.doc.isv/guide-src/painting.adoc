== Painting of Figures

Figures are painted using a `Graphics`. The Graphics abstraction allows
Draw2d to wrapper an SWT GC for extended functionality as well as
performance optimizations. For example, Graphics supports pushing and
popping of the current state.Â A figure paints using the following
process:

* link:../reference/api/org/eclipse/draw2d/Figure.html#paint(org.eclipse.draw2d.Graphics)[*`Figure#paint(Graphics)`*] -
This method is declared on the interface, and kicks off the painting
process. First, properties are set on the Graphics that would be
inherited by children, including Font, background, and foreground Color.
Then the Graphics state is pushed so that just these inherited settings
can be restored when painting children. Next, the following methods are
called:
** link:../reference/api/org/eclipse/draw2d/Figure.html#paintFigure(org.eclipse.draw2d.Graphics)[*`Figure#paintFigure(Graphics)`*] -
The figure paints itself. Figures are not required to paint at all. A
simple form of painting would be to fill in the bounding box with the
figure's background color.
** link:../reference/api/org/eclipse/draw2d/Figure.html#paintClientArea(org.eclipse.draw2d.Graphics)[*`Figure#paintClientArea(Graphics)`*] -
The client area is where children appear. This method should apply any
changes to the Graphics which affect only children, such as coordinate
system modifications like translating the graphics to the client area.
This method also clips the graphics two the region where children
are allowed to appear.
*** link:../reference/api/org/eclipse/draw2d/Figure.html#paintChildren(org.eclipse.draw2d.Graphics)[*`Figure#paintChildren(Graphics)`*] -
Now that the client area is setup, children are painted. After each
child paints, the graphics state is restored to the incoming state so
that children do not overwrite the inherited graphics settings from the
parent.
** link:../reference/api/org/eclipse/draw2d/Figure.html#paintBorder(org.eclipse.draw2d.Graphics)[*`Figure#paintBorder(Graphics)`*] -
Finally, the figure paints decorations which should appear on top of
the children. If a Border has been set on the figure, it paints now.

=== Z-Order

The result of this process is that a figure composition (which
structurally is a tree) paints in a pre-order, depth-first manner. The
exception being the borders which are painted post-order. Using push and
pop, changes made to the Graphics by one branch of figures have no
affect on other branches. The order in which figures paint is often
referred to as z-order. This term comes from the fact that the paint
order creates the illusion of depth, and the z-axis would be
perpendicular to the display's x and y axes. Z-order or paint order is
also manifested in the way hit testing is done.

=== Clipping

When a figure paints its children, it first clips the Graphics to its
client area. As each child is painted, the graphics is also clipped to
the child's bounds. This prevents the child from painting outside of its
bounds or the client area of the parent. Clipping is cumulative based on
the entire parent chain. Below, Figure 3 is parented by Figure 2, which
is parented by Figure 1.
