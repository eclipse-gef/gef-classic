= Coordinate Systems

== Coordinate Systems

Draw2d provides a flexible coordinate with simple defaults. Different
coordinate systems are required by certain optimizations and features
provided by draw2d. A coordinate system is nothing more than an
adjustment made to the Draw2d `Graphics` when painting children
(coordinate systems have *no affect* on the way a figure paints itself).
For example, it is possible to translate or zoom a Graphics. Both of
these operations affect subsequent paint calls. To match what you see,
operations like searching for a figure at a point must respect such
coordinate changes.

The default coordinate system is very simple, it is the same for every
figure. So it doesn't matter if a figure is parented by another figure,
you could compare the bounding boxes directly to each other. When the
figures paint, they all paint in the same coordinates, and when hit
testing is performed, the location is not modified when searching
recursively through the children. This coordinate system is called
_absolute_. If a figure uses absolute coordinates, when it moves, it
must also translate its children by the same amount. "Absolute" may not
be the best choice of words. "Inherited" is probably more accurate,
since children are inheriting the parent's coordinate system, which
could be anything.

The opposite of absolute (or inherited) coordinates is _relative_ (also
_local)_. In a relative coordinate system, the bounds of children are
relative to the client area of their parent. The client area is the
parent's bounds unless the parent has insets. When a figure with
relative coordinates is moved, the children come along for free, without
any changes to their bounds.

=== Relative vs. Absolute

The default coordinate system is absolute and is often left unchanged. A
figure can easily change the coordinate system used for its children by
overriding useLocalCoordinates(). The following table shows some
possible reasons to choose either.

|===
|*Task* |*Absolute Coordinates* |*Relative Coordinates*

|Translate/move a figure |The figure and all of its children must be
translated, which can be expensive in extreme cases. |Only the figure's
bounds must be updated. The children move for free.

|Hit-test / determine repaint regions |No adjustments are needed to
coordinates. |Some simple math is used to adjust coordinates and
rectangles to/from the coordinate system's origin.

|Observe the figure's "location" on the Canvas |A FigureListener can be
used if the entire parent chain is using absolute coordinates. But this
guarantee is rare. |A FigureListener and CoordinateListener must be
used. You must call translateToAsbolute on the figure being observed to
get its canvas coordinates.

|Determine the bounds of a parent based on the bounds of the children
|Easy - after the children have been position, the parent can then
figure out what its bounds should be. |Extremely hard, since updating
the parent's bounds will cause the children to "move".

=== Other Coordinate Systems

Zooming and scrolling are done specially by the viewport and scalable
layered pane figures provided with Draw2d. Scrolling a drawing is quite
common, and it would be silly if doing this required updating the
bounding rectangle of every figure in the drawing. As an optimization, a
viewport can be constructed with _virtual_ scrolling, which is
implemented by translating the coordinate system's origin.

Zoom is done by scaling the coordinate system about the origin.

=== Working with Absolute Coordinates

The only types of locations which can be passed around and compared in a
meaningful way are absolute. Here, "absolute" means the top-most parent
(or root) figure's coordinate system. When Draw2d is used with SWT
Canvas, an absolute location is the location on that Canvas. To get the
location on the Display (i.e. the monitor), you would then have to use
the utilities on SWT's Display to convert from a Control to the Display.

To convert to and from absolute coordinates, utility methods are defined
on IFigure. These methods will convert any object implementing the
` Translatable` interface (historical note: zoom was not in the first
draw2d release so translation was the only type of converting
necessary).

* link:../reference/api/org/eclipse/draw2d/IFigure.html#translateToAbsolute(org.eclipse.draw2d.geometry.Translatable)[*`translateToAbsolute(Translatable)`*] -
converts from the receiver's coordinates to absolute coordinates.
Note that the receiver's coordinate system is the system in which
the receiver is placed, and *not* the coordinates in which it
places its children.
* link:../reference/api/org/eclipse/draw2d/IFigure.html#translateToRelative(org.eclipse.draw2d.geometry.Translatable)[*`translateToRelative(Translatable)`*] -
converts from absolute coordinates to the receiver's coordinates.
The above methods are implemented recursively by walking up the parent
chain and performing the conversion for each parent. It's not easy to
extend the behavior of a recursive method, so the actual conversions are
factored out into separate methods.  These methods are also public and
are called in some situations.
* link:../reference/api/org/eclipse/draw2d/IFigure.html#translateToParent(org.eclipse.draw2d.geometry.Translatable)[*`translateToParent(Translatable)`*] -
converts from the coordinate system defined by the receiver.  If the
receiver uses absolute/inherited coordinates, no conversion is performed.
* link:../reference/api/org/eclipse/draw2d/IFigure.html#translateFromParent(org.eclipse.draw2d.geometry.Translatable)[*`translateFromParent(Translatable)`*] -
converts to the coordinate system defined by the receiver.

==== Example: How to place a Shell on top of a Figure

____
Given a figure that is displayed on a Canvas, how do we popup a shell
such that it is in exactly the same location on the screen?
____

==== Solution:

____
First, take the figure's location and convert it to the canvas. Note
that the figure's bounds are returned by reference, so you need to
create a copy to avoid modifying the original bounds. Next, create an
SWT Rectangle and convert it to the display's coordinates:

[source,java]
----
public void example1(Shell shell, Figure figure, Canvas canvas) {
    org.eclipse.draw2d.geometry.Rectangle r;
    org.eclipse.swt.graphics.Rectangle swtRect;

    r = figure.getBounds().getCopy();
    figure.translateToAbsolute(r);

    swtRect = new org.eclipse.swt.graphics.Rectangle(r.x, r.y, r.width, r.height);
    shell.setBounds(canvas.getDisplay().map(canvas, null, swtRect));
}

==== Example: How to Position a Connection using an Anchor

____
Given a ConnectionAnchor, what is the proper way to set the endpoint of
a connection?
____

==== Solution:

____
A connection anchor is a helper object that returns a Point in absolute
coordinates. The connection figure can be inside a figure such as a
viewport or layer that has its own coordinate system. The following code
makes the necessary conversion:

[source,java]
----
public void example2(Connection connection, ConnectionAnchor sourceAnchor, Point reference) {
    Point anchorpoint = sourceAnchor.getLocation(reference);
    connection.translateToRelative(anchorpoint);

    PointList list = connection.getPoints();
    list.setPoint(anchorpoint, 0);
    connection.setPoints(list);
}
