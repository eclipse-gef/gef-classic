= Hit Testing

== Hit Testing

There are several situations which require finding a figure for a mouse
location. For example, determining which tooltip to display when the
mouse pauses on top of a figure canvas. Another example is interactive
graphical applications, which must interpret dragging one figure on top
of another.

There are four methods available on IFigure which perform hit testing,
three of which are actually just convenience methods which call the
fourth.

* link:../reference/api/org/eclipse/draw2d/IFigure.html#findFigureAt(int,int)[*`findFigureAt(int x, int y)`*] -
finds the top-most figure for the given x and y coordinate.
* link:../reference/api/org/eclipse/draw2d/IFigure.html#findFigureAt(org.eclipse.draw2d.geometry.Point)[*`findFigureAt(Point p)`*] -
similar to above, except takes a Point instead of an int.
* link:../reference/api/org/eclipse/draw2d/IFigure.html#findFigureAtExcluding(int,int,java.util.Collection)[*`findFigureAtExcluding(int x, int y, Collection exclude)`*] -
finds the top-most figure for the given coordinates that is not in the
exclusion set or contained by a figure in the exclusion set. This is
used for ignoring a figure being dragged, or for ignoring transparent
layers or figures which are not involved in an interaction.
* link:../reference/api/org/eclipse/draw2d/IFigure.html#findFigureAt(int,int,org.eclipse.draw2d.TreeSearch)[*`findFigureAt(int x, int y, TreeSearch)`*] -
All of the above methods call this method. TreeSearch is a helper that
is used to quickly prune branches which should not be searched, and to
accept the final candidate figure.

Hit testing must be done exactly the same way as painting. Clipping and
coordinate changes must be duplicated in both. As an optimizations,
branches of the figure composition tree are pruned by calling
`containsPoint()`. If a figure does not contain the location, it returns
NULL and does not search its children. By default, all figures are
considered to be the rectangular region defined by their bounds,
regardless of how or if they paint. This can be overridden as it is in
Polyline, Ellipse, and other figures.
